# pyDRTtools

We are pleased to introduce the pyDRTtools, is the python version of DRTtools for computing distribution relaxation times (DRT) from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. 

**What is the pyDRTtools? Why would I want it?**

pyDRTtools is a Python GUI that analyzes EIS data via the DRT model. pyDRTtools includes:

- an intuitive GUI for computing DRT based on Tikhonov regularization

- several options for optimizing the estimation of the DRT

- a sampler that allows you to determine the credible intervals of your DRT
  
- an optimal selection of the regularization parameter

- Hilbert-transform subroutines that allow you to assess and score the quality of your data

Hopefully, by now you are inclined to think that this toolbox may be useful to the interpretation of your EIS data. If you are interested, you will find an explanation of the toolbox's capabilities it in the user's guide as well as in the references below.
